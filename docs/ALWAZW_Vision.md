I want you to review, enhance and elevate my suggested improvements: 


##################################################################################################
## Phase 1 ## 
Underlying infrastructure
Order Acceptance Process - Pre-Shipping
##################################################################################################

## Stack ##
- current version was a project mock to test its viability and currently uses scattered json files
- a proper db needs to deployed as a self hosted docker service. db will be the backbone of the entire project that is the data aggregation central point and powers the downstream fulfilment, customer service chatbot, accounting, analytics and additional modules to come.  
- customer service and other agentic ai will need some form of rag ecosystem. I'm not sure which db to chose and whether it would be more sound from a design perspective to use the same or seperate dbs for:
data aggregation, clean up and modeling & AI db 
- also rename "Orders" to "order_management"

## Web interface ##
- a solid web interface with detailed attention to UI/UX is required. it might still be too soon for a full plan but could be tailor built according to each module completion


### Process ###

## process flow trigger ##
- it would be more ideal if there's are push web-hook API to rely on from bb or some web-hook s to trigger order & shipping management
- if not the current 15 min scheduler is still OK

## orders "pending acceptance" ##
once triggered by web-hook API, web-hook or scheduled task, order acceptance is supposed to 
--> retrieve all orders with pending acceptance status --> accept the orders --> log web-hook API calls made for acceptance with a count of 1 with date-time stamps to a orders_pending_acceptance table --> record all available data points associated with the order --> pause 1 minute --> validate that all accepted orders status updated:

## if status updated to "debit in progress" or "cancelled" --> log status update with date-time --> trigger creating_shipping_label process

## if status remains pending acceptance 
--> loop back to accept it again 
--> re-log order acceptance + increase cumulative count of acceptance attempts with date-time to orders_pending_acceptance table 
--> create log entry to a oreders_pending_acceptance_debug table in case it fails again 
--> as counter reaches 3 failed attempts a validation and audit script would troubleshoot what is being sent and received via web-hook API in an attempt to rectify 
--> 4th failure --> ## missing feature here ## 
--> A notification center could alert to the underlying issue with the troubleshooting diagnostics and required manual intervention

## if status becomes cancelled 
--> log cancellation update with date-time stamp 
--> collecting this event might potential help reveal some insight or something in the analytics module...
--> create new log 

## previously accepted orders status update
once triggered by web-hook API, web-hook or scheduled 
--> retrieve list of all accepted orders and 

 ## create shipping 
--> order management is supposed to log all the orders that got accepted 



##################################################################################################
## Phase 2 ## 
Order Status Updates - Part 2 
Creating Shipping labels 
updating order shipping information 
Marking Orders as shipped
##################################################################################################

## order status changes to debit in progress once accepted
--> order status updates to "awaiting shipment" once bb clears the payment
--> process should log date time stamp of this update 
--> shipping label creation is triggered at this point with canada post via web-hook API
--> web-hook API call gets logged along with all the response details
--> web-hook API call also retrieves and saves pdf shipping label  
--> process re-validates shipping information from the order against the web-hook API response to ensure details are correct
--> Updating order tracking number and marking the order as shipped is triggered once the shipping details validation is complete
--> a process validates order status updated to "shipped"

##################################################################################################
## Phase 3 ##
Understanding of Product Offering Structure 
Inventory Database schema and architecture
Inventory Management Module
##################################################################################################

## Understanding product design ##
- laptop models are usually offered in different variant combinations that mostly include different:
RAM capacity, SSD storage capacity, some models might not be listed with additional Accessories while others might include different combination of number of accessories ex. backpacks, carry cases, sleeves, usb drives, gift cards, pre-paid subscriptions, mouse, wireless numpads...
- each variant is assigned a unique shop sku
- each shop sku could have 1 or multiple offer skus
- different models might have different upgrade components based on their base model specs ex. 
--> some models might be offered in 16gb ram capacity by requiring 2x 8gb ram sticks if they have 2 ram slots
--> other models might have 1 ram slot and would require a 1x 16gb ram stick
--> other models might have built in 8gb ram and have only 1 ram slot so an additional 1x 8gb ram stick is needed
--> other models might have 8gb buit in ram with 2 ram slots assigned 2x 4gb ram sticks
while this is the main understanding of a variant structure a low stock inventory in 8gb ram sticks could change the decision to include 1x 16gb ram stick despite it having 2 ram slots for this shop sku under a different offer sku...
--> An item might be listed as an independant product or as a variant within a variant group
--> It will very common to have multiple listing of the same product with the exact same specs listed with similar or different titles, descriptions and/or pictures as part of an A/B strategy to test different price points or to simply have additional exposure within the bb platform product hierarchy grouping. From a platform perspective each listing is considered a different product with its unique shop and offer skus. This is an important point that will map out and have an important downstream impact on Inventory Management, Accounting and Analytics Modules.


## Inventory Module ## 
--> I provided all these example as they would be the foundational core of: 
--> Database architecture and creating relevant data schemas
--> I repeat the previous point here
--> --> It will very common to have multiple listing of the same product with the exact same specs listed with similar or different titles, descriptions and/or pictures as part of an A/B strategy to test different price points or to simply have additional exposure within the bb platform product hierarchy grouping. From a platform perspective each listing is considered a different product with its unique shop and offer skus. This is an important point that will map out and have an important downstream impact on Inventory Management, Accounting and Analytics Modules.
--> There should be solid strategy for grouping the multiple listings of the same model variant offering with their own shop/offer sku back to a unique ID as they are really just different flavors of the same product, specs and accessory offering combination. 
--> the unique variant IDs should also roll up to base model they were initially derived from
--> I have quasi systematic approach in terms of creating skus demonstrated with a couple of examples:
--> --> Dell Inspiron 15.6" touchscreen with 32GB Ram and 512 SSD would be something along the lines of Inspiron-15.6-touch-32-512 vs. Inspiron-15.6-touch-32-1000 (1TB)
--> --> HP-black-14-numpad-usb-bkpk... first parts of the skus are product identifiers while last parts refers to specs and/or accrssories 

## foundational requirements for the inventory admin web interface features ##
--> there should an intelligent and automated approach to easily create the product roll up mapings
--> Features I can think about now are creating, monitoring, editing and deleting entries from the database. 
--> Have an automated script to read and understand short and long descriptions while deciphering sku to create this mapping is crucial   
--> a a copy of a listing as a template with autofill/auto suggesting values as a features will be a big enhancement to the process of unifying all listting sku creation.
--> The web admin web interface should have an admin console to roll up as well as create, enable, create, duplicate, edit,delete the roll up grouping mapped to characteristics and specs of different shop skus power with some sort of automation and intelligent clean up of skus to facilitate Inventory management.
--> So far I found my approach was compatible with all my listings. yet, i am also open to a more intelligent or proffesional approach. 
--> I strip down a model from all its non built in specs for RAM and SSD as a stipped down unique product. 
--> Each ram, ssd and accessory are considered independant products
--> the extracted ram and ssds are then added to the inventory count of their product ex. 4,8,16,32 gb sticks or 256,512,1tb,2tb,4tb ssds...
--> then each variant sku of a model would be considered as a purchase of individual products bundled into a sku.
--> but this is just a suggestion.

## Phase 4 ##
Understanding fulfillment process flow
Design of integrated multiple build in failsafes and validations to completely eradicate fulfilment operational risk
Sequence and triggers at different steps of the process flow
