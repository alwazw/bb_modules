# Inventory Module

This module is designed to manage the inventory of products and components. It is currently in a placeholder state for future development (Phase 3), but the foundational database utilities are in place.

## Key Components

*   **`workflow.py`**: The main entry point for the inventory management workflow. This is currently a placeholder and does not contain any functional logic.
*   **`db_utils.py`**: A set of utility functions for interacting with the inventory-related tables in the database. This includes functions for creating new components and base products.

## Future Development (Phase 3)

The following features are planned for the full implementation of this module:

*   **SKU Mapping**: Logic to map shop-specific SKUs to internal product variants.
*   **Inventory Tracking**: Functions to manage the inventory levels of individual components.
*   **Web Interface**: A web-based interface for viewing and managing inventory.

This module will be a critical part of the application, providing the data necessary for order fulfillment and for managing stock levels on the marketplace.
