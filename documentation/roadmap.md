# Project Roadmap

## Vision

To create a fully autonomous, data-driven e-commerce automation platform that handles all aspects of order fulfillment, inventory management, and customer service with minimal human intervention. The system will be intelligent, resilient, and extensible, allowing for the easy addition of new features and integrations.

## Phase 1: Foundational Architecture (Complete)

This phase focused on building the core architecture of the application.

-   **Containerization:** The entire application is containerized with Docker and Docker Compose.
-   **Database Backend:** A PostgreSQL database serves as the single source of truth.
-   **Modular Workflows:** The application is broken down into distinct, modular workflows.
-   **Web Interfaces:** Basic web interfaces for fulfillment and customer service have been created.
-   **Initial Automation:** The core workflows for order acceptance, shipping, and tracking have been implemented.

## Phase 2: Robustness and Monitoring (In Progress)

This phase focuses on making the system more robust and adding monitoring and observability.

-   **Stress Testing and Hardening:**
    -   [x] Prevent duplicate shipping labels.
    -   [ ] Add more comprehensive error handling and retry logic to all workflows.
    -   [ ] Implement a dead-letter queue for failed messages and events.
-   **Monitoring and Observability:**
    -   [x] Add Grafana to the Docker stack for monitoring.
    -   [ ] Create a comprehensive set of Grafana dashboards to monitor key metrics (e.g., order volume, processing times, error rates).
    -   [ ] Implement structured logging (e.g., JSON logs) to make logs easier to parse and analyze.
-   **Refactor File-Based Workflows:**
    -   [ ] Refactor the fulfillment service to use the database instead of a JSON file.
    -   [ ] Refactor the customer service message aggregation to use webhooks instead of polling, and to write directly to the database.

## Phase 3: Intelligent Customer Service

This phase focuses on evolving the customer service module into an intelligent, autonomous agent.

-   **Real-Time Message Ingestion:** Implement real-time message ingestion using webhooks.
-   **RAG System:** Implement a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system to provide context-aware answers to customer queries.
-   **Intelligent Co-pilot:** Build an "intelligent co-pilot" for human agents that can draft replies for their review.
-   **Internal Business Data APIs:** Create internal APIs to give the LLM access to live business data (e.g., inventory, order costs).

## Phase 4: Autonomous Operation

This phase focuses on enabling the system to handle common queries autonomously.

-   **Intent Classification:** Implement intent classification to determine whether the system can handle a request itself or if it needs to escalate to a human.
-   **Full Automation:** For high-confidence intents, enable the system to handle the entire workflow from start to finish without human intervention.
-   **Proactive Notifications:** Implement proactive notifications to customers (e.g., "Your order has shipped").

## Phase 5: Advanced Features

This phase focuses on adding advanced features to the platform.

-   **Inventory Management:** Implement a full inventory management system, including stock level tracking, purchase order generation, and supplier management.
-   **Multi-Channel Support:** Add support for other e-commerce platforms (e.g., Shopify, Amazon).
-   **Advanced Analytics:** Implement advanced analytics and reporting to provide insights into business performance.
-   **Machine Learning:** Use machine learning to predict sales trends, optimize pricing, and personalize customer interactions.
